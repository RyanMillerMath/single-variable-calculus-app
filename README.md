#Single-Variable Calculus, the App!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run this app, run "react-scripts start" or "npm start" from a node.js command prompt to start the app on your localhost.

Newton API, which this app uses, assumes common variable names, such as x, y, z, and t.
